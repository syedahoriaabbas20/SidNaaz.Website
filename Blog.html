            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Origination Of #SidNaaz: Why Are They So Loved?:</h2>
              <p>One of the famous hashtags that are currently getting so trendy is #SidNaaz. 
                The Big Boss 13 contestants Sidharth Shukla and Shehnaaz Gill are one of the
                 most loved contestants in the show’s history. A bond so beautiful couldn’t be 
                 hidden for very long and as season 13 came to an end many people started addressing 
                 themselves as Sidnaazian.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Let’s Know Them Better:</h4>

             <p>Before directly jumping to the hashtag let’s see a bit of backstory know these two 
               stars better. So lets first see a bit about the one and only Punjab Ki Katrina Kaif and
                our favourite Shehnaaz Kaur Gill.
                 <br>
                 <h3>Shehnaaz Kaur Gill:</h3>
                <img src="images/12.jpg"> <br> </p>
  
             <p>Shehnaaz Kaur Gill also famously known as Sana is a 26-year-old Punjabi Singer,
                model and actress. For all those who had no idea about her, she actually stepped
                 into this industry as a model. Her mom was very much supportive but Shehnaaz’s dad
                  being a politician was against this move. However, she started receiving fame because
                   of her cuteness and magical bold voice along with acting skills in the Punjab industry.
                    <br> <br><br>
               </p>

               <p>Before entering into the Bigg Boss house she got into a huge controversy with 
                 another Punjabi singer/actress Himanshi Khurana who also appeared in the same show.
                  Her hobbies are making Dubsmash and dancing also Shehnaaz loves Indian food. 
                  She especially likes Kadhai Paneer and it is very well-known to fans that she is
                   very close to her brother Shehbaz who also appeared in the Bigg Boss house to support
                    her. Some more information regarding Shehnaaz Gill:

            <h2>Origination Of #SidNaaz:</h2>
            <img src="images/14.jpg" alt="" height="450px"> <br> <br>
            <p>Even though Season 13 was one of the biggest hits, a lot of that credit goes to this 
              famous pair. This wasn’t a first, even in earlier seasons contestants were paired by the 
              fans. There were other couple hashtags created such as #pahira and #asimanshi. Some of them
               openly stated their relationships whereas others kept quiet about it. <br> <br>
              
               But what exactly is the relationship between Sidharth Shukla and Shehnaaz Gill that has
                by far surpassed the followership of any other couple? As a matter of fact, we haven’t 
                seen a Bollywood couple getting so much attention as these two. <br><br>
              
                The duo still maintains that they are just friends but the number of fans shipping 
                them keeps increasing with every passing day. When the contestants of Bigg Boss were 
                forming groups and fighting each other the journey of SidNaaz depicted something else.</p>
                <img src="images/15.jpg" alt="" height="450px"> <br><br>

               <p>There were fights and arguments but the duo overcame everything.
                 In many such situations when their thoughts did not match we saw them parting ways
                  only to be reunited as if they were destined to be together. Even when Sidharth won the
                   trophy, the first thing he did was hug Shehnaaz and that moment became the highlight of
                    the season.</p>
                    <img src="images/16.jpg" alt="" height="450px"> <br><br>
                    
           <p>They shared so many cute moments that together they overwhelmed their fans.
            Even when Shehnaaz and Sidharth fought on the show, they always clarified their 
            misunderstanding later and continued supporting each other.</p> 
            <hr> <br>
            <p>As Bigg Boss season 13 came to an end, the makers of the show decided to organize 
              another show named Mujhse Shaadi Karoge, where Shehnaaz and Paras had to find their 
              soul mates. Although many Sidnaazians were opposing it initially, they could all relax
               when Shehnaaz could not find a match for her. Well, the fans said that it had to happen
                since Sidharth Shukla was not a part of the show. He only appeared, in the beginning, 
                to help Shehnaaz find a perfect match and left later.</p> <br>

                <p>When Sidharth’s mother made an appearance on the show and met Shehnaaz every 
                  Sidnaazian’s heart skipped a beat. The way Sidharth introduced her to his mother
                   was so gentle and full of chivalry. Many fans commented that Shehnaaz’s nervous 
                   look while meeting Sid’s mother was really cute. In that moment, the couple said 
                   a lot through their actions and expressions without saying anything.</p>
                   <img src="images/17.jpg" alt="" height="350px"> <br><br>

                   <p>Both of them have their own fan following as well. 
                     Fans who love only Shehnaaz call themselves as Shehenaazian and the Sidharth 
                     fans call themselves SidHearts. But when they come together it’s a different level 
                     of revelry that we have not witnessed for any other onscreen couple. </p>

                     <h2>Their Career Together:</h2>
                     <p>Being from the same industry, fans especially the ones who ship Shehnaaz 
                       and Sidharth got to see them working together a lot. From Bhula Dunga to
                   Shona Shona, the songs by SidNaaz have been super hit with few weeks of the launch.</p>

                   <img src="images/18.jpg" alt="" height="350px">
                   <img src="images/19.jpg" alt="" height="350px"> <br> <br>

                   <p>The Punjab Ki Katrina Kaif was new to Mumbai and when she was starting 
                     her career here there was so much news stating how Sidharth Shukla helped her
                      to find a house and arrange a designer for her.</p> <hr> <br>
                      <p>The duo is also spotted together at many places and there are fans who keep
                         them tracking to get at least one chance to meet them in person. When the couple
                          left for Punjab we could see the crowd following them all the way in Punjab.</p>

                          <img src="images/20.jpg" alt=""  height="350px">
                          <img src="images/21.jpg" alt=""  height="350px"> <br><br>

                          <p>Sidharth Shukla’s family is said to be very close to Shehnaaz and she 
                            makes an appearance with them quite often. So much so that when the duo was
                             leaving for Punjab Sidharth’s mom, sister and brother-in-law came to see them
                              off. <br> <br>
                            <img src="images/22.jpg" alt="" height="350px">
                            <img src="images/23.jpg" alt="" height="350px"></p> <br>

                            <p>The duo had so many cute moments inside and outside the Bigg Boss
                               house that it is really hard to mention all of them together, but the
                                journey of Sidnaaz does not end here. Although they have an age gap of 
                                14 years they do bond very well. <br></p>
                                <img src="images/24.jpg" alt="" height="250px">
                                <img src="images/25.jpg" alt="" height="250px"> <hr><br>

                           <p>It is is said that a Sagittarius and an Aquarius are a perfect love match
                              with a bit of humility with each other. May be as every Sidnaazian’s heart
                               wants they might finally announce something about their love life!</p>
                               <br> <br>

                           <p>Anyways there is surely more to come from the 
                             celebrated duo and we will continue to tell you as it happens.
                              Till then, please pray that Sidnaaz Reunion happen one more time in this world,
                              keep visiting us and keep enjoying our content!</p>
